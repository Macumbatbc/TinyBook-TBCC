# TinyBook-TBCC
Clean and compact spellbook which only shows the highest rank of each spell ported to TBC Classic.

Original version from Retail TBC 2.4.3
https://github.com/Bananaman/TinyBook

This is a fresh, clean and compact spellbook which only shows the highest rank of each spell. And if you ever want to downrank your spells to a lower rank, you can simply hover over a spell to see all other ranks. Easy and intuitive!

It's time that we finally enjoy our spellbooks; liberated from the clutter of endless pages! No more! No more...

# Download: 
DL TinyBook-master.zip and Put the folder into your WoW's "Interface/AddOns" folder, then rename it and delete "-master".
